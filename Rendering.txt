In React, rendering refers to the process of converting React components into actual UI elements that are displayed on the screen. When you build a React application, you create a hierarchy of components that represent different parts of your user interface. These components are composed of JSX (a syntax extension for JavaScript) that defines how the UI should look.

When your application runs, React takes these components and renders them into the DOM (Document Object Model) of your web page. This process involves creating actual HTML elements and adding them to the DOM based on the component hierarchy you've defined. React efficiently manages this process by updating only the parts of the DOM that have changed due to updates in your application's state or props.

React uses a concept called the "Virtual DOM" to optimize rendering. The Virtual DOM is an abstraction that represents the actual DOM elements in a more efficient way. When the state or props of a component change, React doesn't immediately update the real DOM. Instead, it first updates the Virtual DOM and performs a "diffing" process to identify the minimal set of changes needed to update the real DOM. This minimizes the actual DOM manipulation and makes the application more efficient.

In summary, rendering in React refers to the process of converting your component hierarchy into visible UI elements on the screen using the Virtual DOM and efficient DOM manipulation techniques to minimize the performance impact of updates.
